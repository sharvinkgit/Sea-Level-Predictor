1. Project Objective
The project analyzes historical sea level data and predicts future trends using Python. By employing statistical methods and visualization tools, it identifies patterns and models future changes in sea level.

2. Dataset Overview
File Name: epa-sea-level.csv
Content:
The dataset includes annual sea level measurements adjusted for climate factors by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation).
Columns: Year and CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level (in inches).
Usage: The dataset is read using Pandas to create visualizations and calculate linear regression lines for predictions.
3. Code Structure and Flow
A. Main File: main.py

Purpose: Entry point for running the project.
Calls the function draw_plot() from sea_level_predictor.py.
Runs automated unit tests if implemented (though test_module is not provided here).
B. Prediction Logic: sea_level_predictor.py

Libraries Used:

pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot for visualization.
scipy.stats.linregress for statistical regression analysis.
numpy for numerical computations.
Key Function: draw_plot()

Reading the Data:
The dataset is read from epa-sea-level.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.

Scatter Plot Creation:
A scatter plot is generated to visualize historical sea level trends.

First Line of Best Fit (Entire Dataset):

A regression line (lineA) is calculated using linregress for the entire dataset.
Predicted sea levels are plotted from the dataset's minimum year to 2050 (xA).
Second Line of Best Fit (Data from 2000 Onwards):

A subset of data from the year 2000 onwards (df_2000) is created.
A separate regression line (lineB) is calculated for this subset.
Predicted values are plotted for the years 2000 to 2050 (xB).
Plot Customization:

Title: "Rise in Sea Level".
X-axis: "Year".
Y-axis: "Sea Level (inches)".
Saving the Plot:
The plot is saved as sea_level_plot.png.

4. Analysis and Insights
Visualization:
The scatter plot provides a visual understanding of the sea level changes over time. The two regression lines allow comparisons between the overall trend and the recent trend (post-2000).

Statistical Trends:

The project effectively uses regression analysis to model trends, showing a steady rise in sea levels.
Predicting until 2050 helps to highlight the potential impacts of climate change on sea levels.
Second Line of Best Fit:
By isolating data from 2000 onward, the project emphasizes recent changes, which are crucial for understanding accelerated impacts of global warming.

5. Strengths of the Project
Clear Objective: Focused on a relevant and critical environmental issue.
Efficient Use of Libraries: Well-optimized use of Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and NumPy.
Detailed Visualization: The dual regression lines provide comprehensive insights into historical and recent trends.
Reusable Code: Encapsulating functionality in draw_plot() allows scalability and reuse.
6. Suggestions for Improvement
Dataset Details: Include more metadata or references to clarify the source and context of the dataset.
Prediction Validation: Incorporate validation metrics (e.g., RÂ² score) to assess the accuracy of predictions.
Additional Visualizations:
Histogram or box plot to display data distribution.
Trend comparisons between regions (if data supports it).
Dynamic Predictions: Allow user inputs to set future prediction years dynamically.
Climate Scenarios: Integrate additional datasets to simulate various climate change scenarios.
7. Conclusion
The Sea Level Predictor project effectively demonstrates the use of Python for environmental data analysis and trend prediction. Its statistical and visual approach provides meaningful insights into sea level changes, making it a valuable tool for climate research and awareness.
